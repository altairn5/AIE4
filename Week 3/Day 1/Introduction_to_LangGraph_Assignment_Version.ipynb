        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval, such as keyword matching, semantic search, or more advanced methods like dense retrieval using embeddings.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved information and the input query. It typically uses a language model, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text.\\n\\n### How RAG Works\\n\\n1. **Input Query**: The system receives an input query from the user.\\n2. **Retrieval Step**: The retrieval component searches a large corpus to find the most relevant documents or pieces of information related to the query.\\n3. **Augmentation Step**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input query, providing additional context and details.\\n4. **Generation Step**: The generation component uses the augmented query to generate a response. The language model takes into account both the original query and the retrieved information to produce a more accurate and informative answer.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG\\n\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging relevant information from a large corpus, the system can provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\\n- **Enhanced Knowledge**: The retrieval component allows the system to access a vast amount of information, making it more knowledgeable and capable of answering a wider range of questions.\\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The generation component can produce responses that are more relevant to the specific context of the query, improving user satisfaction.\\n\\n### Applications\\n\\n- **Question Answering Systems**: RAG can be used to build more effective question-answering systems that provide accurate and detailed answers.\\n- **Customer Support**: It can enhance customer support systems by providing relevant information and generating helpful responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: RAG can assist in content creation by retrieving relevant information and generating coherent text based on that information.\\n\\nOverall, Retrieval Augmented Generation systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods, resulting in more effective and intelligent AI systems.\",\n",

Here are the key improvements:\\n\\n### Fine-Tuning Large Models\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA allows fine-tuning of large models using a small number of learnable parameters. Instead of adjusting the entire weight matrix \\\\( W \\\\) of a pre-trained model, LoRA introduces two smaller, low-rank matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) alongside the original weight matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly.\\n\\n2. **Performance**: Fine-tuning with very low adapter ranks (e.g., 4 to 32) can perform well, and this performance does not necessarily improve with higher ranks. This makes the fine-tuning process more efficient without sacrificing performance.\\n\\n3. **Communication Efficiency**: In federated learning settings, LoRA can be adapted to improve communication efficiency. Techniques like FLASC (Federated LoRA with Sparse Communication) apply sparsity to LoRA during communication, allowing clients to locally fine-tune the entire LoRA module. This method can match the performance of dense LoRA with up to 10 times less communication.\\n\\n4. **Scalability and Flexibility**: LoRA's design allows for scalable and flexible fine-tuning, making it suitable for various machine learning tasks and environments.\\n\\n### IoT Applications\\n1. **Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN)**: LoRA networks are emerging as one of the most promising LPWAN technologies, enabling energy-constrained devices distributed over wide areas to establish affordable connectivity.\\n\\n2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: LoRA networks are designed to be cost-effective, allowing users to build private networks for various IoT applications without relying on third-party infrastructure.\\n\\n3. **Scalability**: The architecture of LoRA networks, including the design of LoRa Gateways and network servers, ensures scalability and flexibility. The network server is divided into decoupled modules and uses a messaging system based on streaming data for interaction between modules.\\n\\n4. **Open Standards**: LoRA specifies an open standard, which has attracted attention from both academia and industry. This openness allows for the development of autonomous LPWAN networks and fosters innovation.\\n\\n5. **Application Scenarios**: LoRA networks have been successfully deployed in various scenarios, such as managing solar plants and power monitoring, demonstrating their practical utility.\\n\\n### Research and Development\\n- **Robustness and Privacy**: In federated learning, LoRA has been studied for its robustness to heterogeneity and privacy concerns.\\n- **Open Issues**: Despite its advantages, there are still research challenges in developing practical LoRA networks, such as link coordination, resource allocation, reliable transmissions, and security.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA's improvements in parameter efficiency, communication efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability make it a valuable method for fine-tuning large models and deploying IoT networks.\",\n",
