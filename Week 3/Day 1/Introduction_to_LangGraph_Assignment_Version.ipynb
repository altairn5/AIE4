        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

Here's a breakdown of the two components:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval-Based Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant information from a large corpus or database based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find documents, passages, or pieces of text that are most relevant to the query.\\n\\n2. **Generation-Based Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved information. It uses techniques from natural language generation (NLG) to create coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n### How RAG Works:\\n1. **Query Input**: The system receives a query or prompt from the user.\\n2. **Information Retrieval**: The retrieval component searches a large corpus to find relevant documents or passages that are related to the query.\\n3. **Response Generation**: The generation component uses the retrieved information to generate a response. This can involve summarizing the retrieved information, answering questions, or generating text that is informed by the retrieved content.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG:\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By leveraging a large corpus of information, RAG systems can provide more accurate and relevant responses.\\n- **Contextual Understanding**: The generation component can create responses that are contextually appropriate and coherent.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG systems can handle a wide range of queries by retrieving and generating responses based on a vast amount of information.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers to user queries by retrieving relevant information and generating a coherent response.\\n- **Content Creation**: Assisting in the creation of articles, reports, or other written content by retrieving relevant information and generating text.\\n- **Customer Support**: Enhancing automated customer support systems by providing relevant and contextually appropriate responses to customer inquiries.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods to create more effective and intelligent AI systems.\",\n",

              "   'output': 'LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Here are some significant improvements that the LoRA system makes:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that are much smaller in size, making the fine-tuning process more efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be stored and updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint of the model during fine-tuning. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Better Generalization**: LoRA can help in achieving better generalization by preventing overfitting. Since only a small number of parameters are being fine-tuned, the model is less likely to overfit to the training data, leading to better performance on unseen data.\\n\\n5. **Modularity**: LoRA allows for modular updates to the model. Different low-rank matrices can be trained for different tasks and then combined with the base model as needed. This modularity makes it easier to adapt a single pre-trained model to multiple tasks.\\n\\n6. **Scalability**: LoRA is scalable to very large models. As models continue to grow in size, the benefits of parameter and memory efficiency become even more pronounced, making LoRA a valuable technique for future advancements in machine learning.\\n\\n7. **Cost-Effectiveness**: By reducing the computational and memory requirements, LoRA makes it more cost-effective to fine-tune large models. This can be particularly important for organizations with limited computational resources.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a powerful technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained models, enabling more efficient and effective adaptation to specific tasks.',\n",
